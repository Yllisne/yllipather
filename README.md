pathing pap files made easy (hopefully)

this is just a repository, use the tool here:
https://yllisne.github.io/yllipather/

what it's supposed to do
- automatically write paths to your pap files in json so you don't need to do it manually for every race
- open already existing .jsons to not mess up what you already pathed (ideally won't touch anything that is not a .pap)

To do (asap):
- save jsons
- move between groups
- make it impossible to drop into titles?


To do (later):
- undo remove button
- individual assigments
- descriptions
- working cloning
